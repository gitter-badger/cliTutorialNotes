## Introduction

-   CLI = Command Line Interface
-   Can do everything a graphical interface can ( apart from audio visual stuff )
-   Works by typing commands

### Why?

Doesn't typing every command seem slow?

-   Not always
-   For certain use cases it's faster
-   For some things there is no GUI (graphical user interface) equivalent
-   Access to all commands within one interface
-   The same commands can be used to automate things using scripts
-   Personalise it to your taste
-   Helpful completions

### Main uses

-   Navigating files and folders
-   Git
-   Launching other applications
-   Running and testing applications you're currently building ( e.g npm for javascript/node, sbt for scala )
-   Accessing production servers

### Folder vs Directory

-   They are the same
-   Will use the terms interchangeably during the tutorial

### Terminal vs iTerm

-   Some people have a strong preference for iTerm
-   Default Terminal app now has most of the same features
-   Use either
