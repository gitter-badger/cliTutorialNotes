## Brew Installation

Copy and pasting commands from the internet and running them in your terminal is never recommended! Especially if you don't understand what it does.

However, Homebrew is very well trusted and used by many devs so you can install it in the following way as per the instructions on their [website](https://brew.sh/)

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
