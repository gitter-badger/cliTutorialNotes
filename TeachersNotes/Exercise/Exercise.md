## Exercise

We're going to change our prompt

-   Check whether `.bash_profile` file exists in the User directory
    ( If you already have one can you let me know )
-   If not create one
-   Open the file in any editor you want, or if you want a challenge open it in `vim`

Using `less` find the `Hidden Code` in [contrivedLessExample.json](contrivedLessExample.json) ( Sorry this a very contrived example of `less` usage )

-   Copy and paste into `.bash_profile` file and then save
-   Open a new tab in the terminal

Navigate to a folder which is also a git repository, your prompt should display the branch name

### Overview

Learn small bits of command line at a time

When you're stuck, `open .` and use finder
